# Plugin/Feature Tracker

Here's where I'll post updates about plugins/features, with my decisions for why I am/am not using them. Ideally I keep this up to date, and make sure that if a limitation with a plugin no longer applies, I give it another shot.

## Features

- Neovim LSP
    - I want to wait until something as simple as CoC.nvim comes along (or at least until someone explains to me how to put all of these pieces together). I tried lspconfig, lspinstall, etc. and they all just... didn't get through to me like I hoped they would.

## Plugins

- vim-clap
    - I'm using this because there's no good workspace symbol support for coc.nvim and vista.vim (I'm using CoC.nvim for reasons that I explained above for "Neovim LSP")
- vim-vsnip
    - Using coc-snippets instead for the time being, should come back to this when I switch over to the LSP
- windline.nvim
    - I've got galaxyline set up the way that I want, and I need to stop fucking around with it. Will mess around with windline when I have more time
