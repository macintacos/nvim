# TODO

There are TODO's sprinkled throughout the project. This is a document to gather TODOs that don't fit cleanly into a document that already exists.

## TODO LIST

- [ ] Look into creating your own theme using Lush. I don't necessarily think that I want to release it, but I want to be able to customize everything to exactly what I need (now that I think about it - don't release it, because then people will think that they want to give feature requests and... I don't really want to care about that)
